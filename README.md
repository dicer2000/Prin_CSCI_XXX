# CSCI XXX - Course Name
Your Name
Principia College - Winter/Spring/Summer 20XX
___
## Directions
This is a markdown template for every Computer Science course at Principia.

The end goal will be to have Github repositories for all the work you did while at Principia College.  This is important to employers and will save you a lot of hassle when you start applying for internships and jobs in the near future.

Each course will have one repository and all that course's projects will be held within it.  This Readme file will act as a template for the class.

While this class is active, the entire repo must be PRIVATE!  After the last day of class, you can switch it to Public.

Additionally, you must add the instructor as a collaborator in order to advise & grade your work.  Do that by going to the repo, click on "Settings" => Manage Access => Add People.

### Customization
Be sure to remove the entire "Directions / Customization" section.  Then fill in each of the relevant areas with information (Such as your name, course name, etc).

As you continue through the course, you will add each project to the "Projects" area below.
